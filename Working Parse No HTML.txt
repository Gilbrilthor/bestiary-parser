The Dracolich’s Phylactery
A dracolich’s spirit returns to its magic phylactery 1d10 days after the dracolich is destroyed. A dracolich’s phylactery usually takes the form of a gem, statuette, or amulet. The only way to get rid of a dracolich permanently is to destroy its phylactery.
A dracolich spirit is trapped in its phylactery and remains dormant until the phylactery comes into contact with another dragon’s corpse, at which point the dracolich's spirit can immediately take possession of the corpse, becoming a “proto-dracolich.” In this new form, it loses its Dominate Undead trait and its dreadful gaze and poison breath actions until it consumes at least a portion of its original body.

ACTIONS
Melee Attack—Slam: +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw.

TRAITS
Berserk: While the golem is in combat, roll a d6 at the start of each of the golem’s turns. If the result is 6, the golem goes berserk until the end of the encounter. On its turn, a berserk golem attacks the nearest creature or some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, and it deals 5 extra bludgeoning damage when it hits with a melee attack.
The berserk golem’s creator can, if it is within 60 feet of the golem and can be seen and heard by the golem, calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively, which requires an action and a DC 16 Charisma check. If the check succeeds, the golem is no longer berserk, although it may go berserk again.
Immunities: The golem is immune to nonmagical weapons except those made of adamantine, as well as disease, cold, lightning, poison, and psychic damage. It cannot be charmed, paralyzed, petrified, stunned, or put to sleep. It does not need to sleep, eat, or breathe.
Whenever the golem would take lightning damage, it instead regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
Magic Resistance: The golem has advantage on saving throws against magical effects.

Green Slime
Medium Ooze (Hazard)
Green slime is a dangerous, unintelligent variety of normal algae that forms in moist subterranean environments. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches. This plant is a slow- growing hazard that feeds on flesh, plant matter, and metal.
Detect: It takes a DC 10 Wisdom check to notice the green slime under normal conditions and a DC 12 Intelligence check to identify the hazard for what it is.
Effect on Creatures: The slime can detect the air vibrations and temperature of living creatures. When it does, a sheet of it large enough to envelop the passing creature drops from its resting place onto the target. The target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the sheet, making the saving throw with disadvantage if the slime was unnoticed or not considered to be a hazard. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 acid damage, and takes another 1d6 acid damage at the end of each of its turns during which it is still in contact with the slime.
A creature that steps in a patch of green slime on the floor receives no saving throw to avoid taking damage.
Effect on Objects: Against wood or metal, green slime deals 2d6 acid damage per round, dissolving about an inch thickness of material each round. Green slime does no harm to stone or glass.
Countermeasures: Green slime can be scraped off or killed by taking 11 damage or more from weapons, cold, or fire. Dealing damage to the slime also deals half damage to the creature it is covering.

A target that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. Failed Save: The target is frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the target must use its movement to move away from the lich. As an action, the frightened target can make a DC 15 Wisdom check to end this effect.

A creature whose hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this attack dies.
Turn Resistance: A lich's hit points are doubled for the purpose of resisting turn undead effects.

Adhesive: Any limb or weapon that touches a mimic becomes stuck to it. If a creature’s limb is stuck, the creature is restrained. It requires a DC 12 Strength check and an action to free a stuck weapon or limb, and once a creature frees all of its stuck limbs, it is no longer restrained. The organic adhesive in the mimic’s skin that causes this stickiness fails if the mimic dies.
Immunity: The mimic cannot be knocked prone.
ACTIONS
Melee Attack—Slam: +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is grappled. The mimic can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.
Change Shape: The mimic polymorphs into any simple Medium object and can remain in this form indefinitely. The mimic’s statistics do not change, but it loses its Ooze Stability trait. A DC 17 Intelligence or Wisdom check reveals that the creature is not what it appears to be, but not the mimic’s true form. The mimic reverts to its natural form when killed.

Mimic Varieties
Mimics come in two varieties. Most are carnivorous predators that crush prey to death and slowly consume it. Such mimics don’t speak. However, a few mimics are more intelligent (Intelligence 8 to 10) and can speak a language (usually Common). Such mimics are likely to be friendly to those who offer bribes of food or treasure. A smarter mimic sometimes leads others of the more feral variety.

Customization Options
Some trolls have the following trait.
Loathsome Limbs: If the troll takes 15 or more damage from a single attack or effect, roll a d20 and consult the table below.
	d20
	Result
	1–10
	No additional effect.
	11–18
	One of the troll’s limbs (determined randomly)
	is severed.
	19–20
	The troll is decapitated but not killed.
The troll loses the attack appropriate to the lost body part until it has regenerated at least 15 hit points (at which point it sprouts a replacement) or until it uses an action to pick up and reattach its severed body part.
A severed body part has AC 9, 5 hit points, a speed of 5 feet, and the troll's Regeneration trait. Severed limbs are considered blinded if the troll’s head cannot see them.
Each severed part acts on the troll's initiative and can make a bite attack (if it’s the head) or a claw attack (if it’s a limb) as an action. If a severed body part regenerates 66 hit points or more, it becomes a whole new troll.

TRAITS
Immunities: The vampire is immune to disease, necrotic, poison, and nonmagical weapons (except those made of cold-forged iron). It cannot be charmed, paralyzed, or put to sleep. It does not need to breathe
Mist Form: If the vampire is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer while not in its coffin, it polymorphs into a cloud of mist. While in mist form, the vampire does not regenerate, cannot take actions, and cannot be damaged (but is destroyed instantly by natural sunlight or a turn undead effect). It gains a fly speed of 20 feet and can squeeze through tiny cracks and openings. If a vampire in mist form starts its turn in its coffin, it returns to its normal form with 1 hit point.
Regeneration: At the start of its turn, the vampire regains 1d10 hit points. If it takes radiant damage, the vampire’s regeneration does not function on its next turn.
Spider Climb: The vampire can climb on smooth walls and upside down on horizontal surfaces.
Vulnerability: The vampire is vulnerable to radiant damage and takes 10 radiant damage each time it starts its turn in direct sunlight.
ACTIONS
Multiattack: The vampire makes two claw attacks. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the vampire can make the following attack against the target.
Melee Attack—Bite: +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature hit by both of the vampire’s claw attacks). Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, the target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt by this attack, and the vampire regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
The reduction to the target’s maximum hit points lasts for 24 hours. A creature whose hit point maximum is
reduced to 0 by this attack dies. A living creature that is killed by the vampire’s bite rises as a vampire under the original vampire’s control on the next night after burial or interment in a tomb.
Melee Attack—Claw: +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.
Domination: The vampire chooses one living humanoid it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failed Save: The target is charmed for 1 day or until the vampire or one of its allies harms it. While the target is charmed, the vampire can decide the target’s action and how it moves. On target’s next turn, it does as the vampire commands. A creature charmed by a vampire in this way receives the commands even if the vampire cannot see it. The charmed creature cannot take reactions.
The vampire can have only one creature charmed at a time. If the charmed creature takes any damage, it can make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.
A creature charmed by this effect remembers being charmed. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw against this effect is immune to this vampire’s domination effect for 24 hours.
